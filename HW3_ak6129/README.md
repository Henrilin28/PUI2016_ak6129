I worked in a group with: Maisha, Laura, Nonie, Santiago

Assignment 1: using distributions Chisq, Normal, Poisson, Binomial, Cauchy generate 100 samples for each one and visialize results using the example from Dr Bianco file. 

Assignment 2: set up question, H0, Ha, and significance level 
###Question: Are users under 30 years of age significantly more likely to bike longer than the average users
###Null(H0): users under the age of 35 are likely to bike for same or shorter duration than the average users
###Alternative(Ha): Users under the age of 35 significantly more likely to bike for longer durations than the average users
significance level = 0.05

uploaded and unzip data

clean data. leave only 2 columns tripdata and birth year. vizualize as histogram. 

Assignment 3: uploaded data than got cond from presentation Question: is the new Bus route imprving commute? Null hypothesis (H0): the commute time is the same or longer with the new bus route as it was before: Tnew >= Told Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): the commute time is shorter with the new bus route as it was before: Tnew < Told significance level: 5%

calculated mean and standart deviaation and z test zscore = ((meanpop) - df.mean())/(stdpop/sqrt(100))
result 2.5563971861666701 shows that we'd  reject the null hypothesis
