For this assignment, for the first part (on compute):

I have created diretory (mkdir)
gittest_ak6129 (jupyter)

added (touch)
myfirstfile.txt

then created online repo 
gittest_ak6129

pushed file (git push)
myfirstfile.txt from directory to online repo

made local changes in file
commit
and push to online repo

after that created changes in file online and push it, and got merge conflict

conflict was fixed through git pull, clean file and repeat 
git add
git commit 
git push

After that I forked Enrique file, made changes, created pull request, and merge pull request

Enrigue forked my file respectively


For the second Assignment

Created directory PUI2016_ak6129 (jupyter)

Created variable environment (nano .bashrc) and alias pui2016

tested pui2016

created repo PUI2016_ak6129

Addedd HW1_ak6129 and README file in it

after that pushed file to online 
git add
git commit 
git push 
to online repo PUI_ak6129
