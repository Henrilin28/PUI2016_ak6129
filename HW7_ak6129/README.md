Assignment_1

I used data from nyc.gov from DOT webpage. 
Data includes number of injuries from road incidents in NYC of pedestrians, bikers, and drivers for several years. 
I read the data and grouped it by total injuries column by year from 2009 til 2016
In order to create plot I used data from 2009 till 2015 because data for 2016 is not complete yet. 
Plot shows the trend of total number of injuries for 7 years.  

Note:
I uploaded original file that was used to do the plot. This file was copied form DOT webpage in October. The link that reffers to csv file is showing now new data, so when you run this notebook, you have to reffer to file saved locally. 
Also I uploaded RoadInjuriesbyYear.png - the picture of plot that I made. This picture could be used in plot review assignment.
