I used data from nyc.gov from DOT webpage. 
Data includes number of injuries from road incidents in NYC of pedestrians, bikers, and drivers for several years. 
I read the data and grouped it by total injuries column by year from 2009 til 2016
In order to create plot I used data from 2009 till 2015 because data for 2016 is not complete yet. 
Plot shows the trend of total number of injuries for 7 years.
